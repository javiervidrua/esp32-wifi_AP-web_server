# esp32-wifi_AP-web_server
Written for a ESP32 development board, using the Arduino IDE.

Creates an open Access Point in the ESP32 that serves files via an asynchronous HTTP server that serves a webpage with 4 buttons that allow the user to change a variable in real-time in the ESP32 code. In other words, the ESP32 has 4 working modes, and you can change them through the webpage, that is served on the default ESP32 IP: *192.168.4.1*.

It has lots of possibilities and it's a great template to develop some interesting projects.
